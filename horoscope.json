        "desc": "Over the next few days, think about what 'family' means to you. This could be your biological family, chosen family, or a community of fellow unicorns that makes you feel like the best version of yourself. Reflect on the traditions and values that have shaped you. Are there any you want to uphold or perhaps redefine? This is the perfect time to forge stronger bonds and create new traditions that reflect your current beliefs and lifestyle. That said, abundance and wealth creation are going to be big themes for you as progress towards the new moon in your sign. Overheard at the cosmic conference: itâ€™s time to step into the Portal of Prosperity in style and share the bounty with those around!",

While it's crucial to stand your ground, it's equally important to strive towards harmony. Remember, disagreement doesn't necessarily mean discord. So, be open to different perspectives and use them as a tool for growth rather than a source of contention. When faced with opposition, take a moment to listen and truly understand where the other person is coming from. PS: You never know what you might learn in the process!",
